# Credit Score Prediction Model 

!

This project provides a machine learning model to predict a user's credit score based on various financial and personal attributes. The prediction model is an `XGBoost Regressor` trained on a synthetically generated dataset reflecting real-world financial behaviors.

A simple web interface is included for demonstration purposes.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Predictive Model**: Utilizes a pre-trained `XGBoost` model for accurate credit score prediction.
-   **Data Preprocessing**: Implements a `scikit-learn` pipeline to handle categorical and numerical data seamlessly.
-   **Ready to Use**: Contains all necessary model files (`.pkl`) for easy integration into other applications.
-   **Demo Interface**: Includes a lightweight web application to demonstrate the model's functionality.
